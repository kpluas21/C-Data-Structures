My implementation of a hash table in C. This data structures stores key-\/value pairs in an array for very fast insertion and searching. HashC is not generic unfortunately, so it uses string keys and int values. However I\textquotesingle{}m sure with a little finesse it can handle any data types.\hypertarget{md_Data_Structures_HashC_README_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{md_Data_Structures_HashC_README_autotoc_md7}
Simply include the header file and make sure your build system points to the header and source file. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#include"{}HashC.h"{}}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_Data_Structures_HashC_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{How to Use}\label{md_Data_Structures_HashC_README_autotoc_md8}
To start using the hash table, you\textquotesingle{}ll need to initialize a pointer to the \mbox{\hyperlink{structHashC__table}{Hash\+C\+\_\+table}} struct like so 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{HashC\_table *hash\_table = HashC\_init();}

\end{DoxyCode}
 It will either return a valid pointer to a HashC table or NULL if anything goes wrong. The default size is 300 key-\/value pairs however that can be changed easily by simply changing the constant in the source file 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#define DEFAULT\_SIZE 300}

\end{DoxyCode}
 From there, simply call the functions as needed. More information can be found in the header file as they are rather straight-\/forward.
