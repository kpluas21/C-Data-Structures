My implementation of popular data structures and programs in C. \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysection{How To Use}\label{md_README_autotoc_md12}
More information on the programs can be found in their respective folders. Each program was made to be as independent as possible. As a result, simply including the header and source file will be enough to use the module. \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysection{Tools Currently Implemented}\label{md_README_autotoc_md13}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structDynamiC}{DynamiC}} \+: A generic dynamic array
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structLinkC}{LinkC}} \+: A generic linked list
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structBstC}{BstC}} \+: A binary search tree using integers
\item HashC \+: A hash table using strings as keys and integers as their respective values
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{structGraphC}{GraphC}} \+: An undirected, unweighted graph with chars as the main key.
