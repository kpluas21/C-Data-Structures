# Kevin's C Library
My implementation of popular data structures and programs in C. 
## How To Use
More information on the programs can be found in their respective folders. Each program was made to be as independent as possible. As a result, simply including the header and source file will be enough to use the module.
## Tools Currently Implemented
* DynamiC : A generic dynamic array
* LinkC   : A generic linked list
* BstC    : A binary search tree using integers
* HashC   : A hash table using strings as keys and integers as their respective values
* GraphC  : An undirected, unweighted graph with chars as the main key.
